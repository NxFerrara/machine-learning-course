# Machine Learning Course Capstone Project

## Introduction
This repository contains my capstone project for the Machine Learning course, focusing on comparing logistic regression, SVM, and neural network models for a classification problem.

## Installation and Setup

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can then install all required libraries by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Analysis Overview
- **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques applied to prepare data for analysis.
- **Model Selection:** Evaluation of different models and their configurations.
- **Regularization Techniques:** Impact on model performance and overfitting.

## Results
My analysis highlights the effectiveness of specific models and parameters, providing insights into feature importance and model accuracies.

## Conclusion
I conclude with recommendations for model improvements and potential future research directions.

For detailed findings and analysis methods, please refer to the project report.
